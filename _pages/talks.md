* I am giving a talk and participating to the workshop on [“Computational methods for probability distributions on manifolds”](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/workshop-computational-methods-for-probability-distributions-on-manifolds-paris-2026/), May 11-13 2026 in Paris


Theory and Methods Challenge Fortnights
======
* I won the call for the [Theory and Methods Challenge Fortnights](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/theory-and-method-challenge-fortnights), which provides funding to organise a two-week intensive challenge on the geometry of data representations

Topology and Geometry for Data interest group
======
* I co-organise the [Topology and Geometry for Data](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/topology-and-geometry-data) interest group at Alan Turing
* I am a member of the [Geometric Statistics Research Group](https://geometricstatisticsgroup.wordpress.com/) at UCL


  

Philosophy of AI seminars
======
* I am co-organising a series of workshops on the philosophy of AI at Alan Turing, exploring aspects such as the impact of AI on the art sector and the various notions of intelligence across scientific fields
