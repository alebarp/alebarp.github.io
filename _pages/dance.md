I love living in London, there are so many opportunities here to explore cultures and discover new activities.
My advice to those moving to London is to try/do everything, from Goth to Bollywood nights, from Improv Comedy to Beach volley (yes you can beach volley in London).
I recommend joining [Sportas](https://www.sportas.co.uk/), [Rueda Libre](https://ruedalibre.co.uk), [Hoopla](https://www.hooplaimpro.com/improv-comedy-club-london-bridge.html), and checking dance studios like [Base](https://www.basedancestudios.com) or [Danceworks](https://danceworks.com).



My favourite activity is dancing, including [azonto/afrobeat](https://www.instagram.com/homebrosuk/?hl=en), [samba](https://www.paraisosamba.co.uk/), [afroheels](https://www.instagram.com/afroinheels/?hl=en), [krump](https://www.instagram.com/wearegsb_/), [capoeira](https://senzala-london.co.uk/), [kizomba](https://www.instagram.com/chocolatekizomba/?hl=en-gb), [afro-bollywood](https://www.instagram.com/afrod3si/?hl=en), salsa, [rueda](https://ruedalibre.co.uk), [bhangra](https://www.instagram.com/jasaulakhbhangra/), [modern Jazz](https://www.instagram.com/diletta_cianci/?hl=en), [voguing](https://www.instagram.com/thegetbusy/) and [amapiano](https://www.instagram.com/takkies7/?hl=en).
London is one of the best places to dance, and dancing is one of the best ways to explore cultures.
My favourite ones are afrohouse and kuduro, both from Angola and Portugal. 
Many people have heard of kuduro through the song "Danza kuduro", but that has little to do with genuine kuduro, which looks like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChvIUNFDJpm/?hl=en).
You can read about the very interesting history of kuduro [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26410069).
To see what afrohouse looks like, check [Septzilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH5k5cNV88Q), who founded the Afrohouselab, or [Will](https://www.instagram.com/_will2k/reel/C1KJQQ9teUe/?hl=en) who creates amazing fusions with other styles.
