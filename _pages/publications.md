Supervision
======

I currently supervise a 1st year PhD student, [Ahab Isaac](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/authors/ahab/), in collaboration with Dr Christopher Banerji (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/christopher-banerji), and cosupervise [Yann McLatchie](https://yannmclatchie.github.io/) with [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io/).

I also regularly supervise BSc and MSc students at UCL.

For students interested in applying to do a PhD with me and the [FSML](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/) research group, 
I am particularly interested in students with (i) solid mathematical foundations, (ii) some programming skills, (iii) a deep interest in computational statistics and machine learning, and, ideally, (iv) have had previous research experience.
